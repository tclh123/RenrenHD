    <span><strong>Known Issues in the Visual Studio International Pack 1.0

</strong></span>
    <br />
    <br />
    
    <ul>
        <li>
            <span>Traditional to Simplified Chinese Conversion Library and Add-In Tool : When user converts the resource file with .zh-TW and .zh-CN culture extensions, the TCSC Conversion Add-In tool will generate the corresponding resource files with .zh-CHT and .zh-CHS culture extension.  This is by design, since zh-TW and zh-CN are specific culture for zh-CHT and zh-CHS.  Under the parent neutral culture, there is more than one specific culture.  The add-in tool can not decide which specific culture should be converted to another.  In our Add-In tool, we will convert the resource files with specific culture extension to neutral culture of the other Chinese language.</span>
